                    Today’s world of work is more complex and volatile than it was years back. Managerial problems, 
                    especially those faced by decision-makers at the highest levels of administration, have become 
                    less structured than they were in the past.  Increasingly, managers have to deal with more sophisticated 
                    technologies, more rapidly expanding and contracting markets.  In adapting to these changes, organizations 
                    have become flatter, smaller and more flexible in structure, more integrative in approach to decision-making, 
                    and more global in operation.

                <p class="academic-program-program-profile">
                    Given the dynamism of our present work environment, it becomes imperative for organizational leaders to 
                    develop the capability to assess a broad spectrum of interrelated issues and to interpret a continuous stream 
                    of data that are vital to decision-making.

                    Decision-makers ought to be humanistic because people are the carriers of today’s most important resources

                    his/her particular area of specialization. The program allows the candidate to earn the 
                    degree through submission, and the successful defense of a dissertation, without the 
                    usual academic course requirements. The program requires the candidate to devote almost 
                    his/her entire residency to research.
